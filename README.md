## Hi there 👋 , 

I'm a passionate penetration tester and vulnerability researcher specializing in web application security, network exploitation, and bug bounty hunting.

🔍 I actively discover and report security vulnerabilities to help improve the safety of online platforms.  
💻 I work with tools like Burp Suite, Nmap, Metasploit, SQLmap, and develop custom scripts in Python to automate security testing.

🌍 I’ve contributed to securing platforms by responsibly disclosing bugs through public and private programs on platforms like HackerOne, Bugcrowd, and Open Bug Bounty.

📂 On this GitHub, you'll find:
- Tools I’ve created or modified for ethical hacking
- Proof-of-concept scripts


🧠 Always learning. Always hacking. Always ethical.
